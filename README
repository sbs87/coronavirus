# Purpose
1. Analyze, track and trend the COVID-19 outbreak in real-time to 
2. Make insights, predictions about future, benchmark against other pandemics.
3. Assess the degree to which social distancing and policy affected the virus outcome  

# Background
The novel coronavirus originated in China circa December 2019 and spread across the globe within months. Initially, most of the world did not think much of it; the U.S. only saw cases around mid-march 2020. Increasingly, governments and businesses started remote work, quarantine procedures, shelter in place. The U.S. and global economies took a hit; local businesses floundered, people were unemployed. The mortality rate was estimated to be 3%, more for older populations, less for younger. 

Much confusion was and is on-going. Many people were initially skeptical of large-scale shutdowns for a seemingly mild virus. A smaller percentage of the population still largely questions whether shutdowns were needed, or at what cost to the long-term economy this would have. 

People wondered and still wonder when the quarantine will be lifted and life return to normal.
